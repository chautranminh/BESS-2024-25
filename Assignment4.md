Normalized Difference Vegetation Index 


Irrigation zones: vegetative production 


Distribution of land: parcelas (to look at the size of agricultural fields and where we can implement margins. 


Include the rivers and we need to include vegetation cover for 20 m every 200 m, so it could be green dotted lines along the river


detect trees and create a 10 m buffer around them
