Normalized Difference Vegetation Index 


Irrigation zones: vegetative production 

## Scale assessment
Distribution of land: parcelas (to look at the size of agricultural fields and where we can implement margins.

Deliverables: Gain data on the crops areas, perimeter, distribution of farmlands based on scale. 
Numbers of alfalfa crops, crops with most areas, crops with furthest distance from shrubs (margins) and where?
Modelling margins,

Deliverables: 

Include the rivers and we need to include vegetation cover for 20 m every 200 m, so it could be green dotted lines along the river


detect trees and create a 10 m buffer around them
