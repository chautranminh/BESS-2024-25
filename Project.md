To estimate the surface area of agricultural fields categorized by the main crops in QGIS, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Ensure Correct Layer Type
Make sure that your map contains a **vector layer** (like polygons) representing the boundaries of agricultural fields. The fields should be polygons, as the surface area calculation applies to polygon features.

### Step 2: Check the CRS (Coordinate Reference System)
The accuracy of area calculations depends on the CRS. For area measurements, it's best to use a **projected CRS**, such as UTM (Universal Transverse Mercator), instead of a geographic CRS like WGS 84 (lat/lon), because the lat/lon system distorts area as you move away from the equator.

1. To check or change the CRS:
   - Go to **Project** > **Properties** > **CRS** tab.
   - Select an appropriate **Projected CRS**, like UTM (e.g., UTM Zone 33N for Europe, depending on your location).

### Step 3: Calculate the Area
To calculate the area of each field (polygon):

1. **Open Field Calculator:**
   - Right-click on your vector layer (the one containing the agricultural fields) in the **Layers panel**.
   - Select **Open Attribute Table**.
   - Click the **Field Calculator** icon (a pencil).

2. **Create a New Field for Area:**
   - In the Field Calculator window, create a new field (e.g., "Field_Area").
   - Set the field type to **Decimal number (real)**.
   - In the **Expression** area, type:  
     ```
     $area
     ```
     This will calculate the area for each polygon.

   - Choose an appropriate **Output field name** (e.g., "Field_Area").
   - Click **OK** to apply and calculate the area.

### Step 4: Check Units
The area will be calculated in the units of the CRS you're using. For example, if you're using UTM, the area might be calculated in **square meters** (m²). To convert the units to something else (e.g., hectares), you can modify the expression in the Field Calculator:

- For **hectares** (ha):  
  ```
  $area / 10000
  ```
- For **square kilometers** (km²):  
  ```
  $area / 1000000
  ```

### Step 5: Attribute Table Review
After calculating, you can review the surface area for each polygon in the **Attribute Table**, where the new area field will be displayed for each agricultural field.

### Optional: Categorize by Crop Type
If you want to categorize the fields by crop type and calculate the area for each category:

1. Make sure you have a **field** (column) in the attribute table that categorizes the crop type.
2. You can use **Group Stats** or the **Field Statistics** tool to summarize the areas by crop type.

To use **Field Statistics**:
- Open the **Attribute Table**.
- Click on the **Field Statistics** button at the bottom of the table.
- Select the **Area field** and the **Crop type field**.
- This will give you the total area for each crop type in your dataset.

### Step 6: Visualize or Export Data
You can now visualize the areas by crop type using symbology or export the attribute table with the area calculations for further analysis.
