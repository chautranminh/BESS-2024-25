Objective:

The purpose of this assignment is to prepare the core spatial analyses and cartographic outputs required for your final challenge report. The outputs of this assignment will directly contribute to your final report, and while they don't need to fully meet its requirements (check them here), the closer they are to being ready for use, the better.

Deliverable:

Markdown Documentation in GitHub Repository:

Create a new .md file in the same GitHub repository you used for Assignments 1 and 2.
Document:
Description of Layers: Provide a detailed explanation of the layers being combined for the analyses, including their relevance to your research question.
Spatial Analysis Plans:
Design at least two spatial analyses, explaining:
The purpose of each analysis.
The QGIS tools and workflows you plan to use, with clear methods and steps.
The expected outcome for each analysis.
Visualization Plans:
At least one map following cartographic rules:
Describe the topic and intended message the viewer should understand from the map.
Specify which layers will be used, how they will be styled, and how the layout will be organized.
Export a high-quality image of the map from QGIS and include it in your documentation (Check instructions on how you can do this using markdown).
Optionally, design a graph or chart to support your analysis, explaining its purpose and including a relevant QGIS export image in your documentation.
Submission:

Submit the URL to your .md file via Blackboard by the end of 29/11/24.

challenge: at least 1 map.
